    "Learning a programming language can be a bit intimidating, but do not worry. You will get used to it pretty quickly. Do not hesitate to ask questions in the seminars or work together with your colleagues. To get the most out of these exercises try to solve the tasks yourself and revisit sections that are unclear to you instead of blindly copying or running these notebooks.\n",

    "Every Python program starts with importing packages or libraries. The command to do so is `import`. We will import `numpy` (see the [docs](https://numpy.org/)) a package that provides numerical operations and allows to work with arrays (matrices). You will see that we use `import numpy as np` which imports the numpy package and makes it accessible via `np`. This is kind of a convention and reduces the amount of code you have to write. In principle, you can use another abbreviation. The second package is `matplotlib` a standard package to create figures.\n",

    "The nice thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can figures directly in the notebook. Jupyter provides so called magic functions that enable certain features in the notebook. For the time being we will use only the `%matplotlib inline` function to display images."
