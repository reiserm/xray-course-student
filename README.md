# Modern X-ray Science: Theory and Applications
(Stockholm University)

This repository contains the programming assignments for the course. You can run the notebooks with `MyBinder` by
clicking on the badge above.

The assignments are provided and should be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
You will find cells that start with the word `TASK` (in case of code it is a comment).
These cells you have to modify. There are essentially three type of tasks to perform:

* write code
* provide parameters
* write short explanations

Often the part where you have to modify the code is emphasized like in the example below.
The variables might be set to some placeholder value that you should change, e.g., `0` or `None`.

```python
### START CODE HERE ###
threshold = 0
I_in = 0
droplet_sizes = [0, 0, 0,]
### END CODE HERE ###
```

**Note**
    Be aware that when you use MyBinder you cannot save the notebook. When you
    finished the assignment, download the notebook and submit it via [Athena](https://athena.itslearning.com/Index.aspx).
